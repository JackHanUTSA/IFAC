This paper has presented a new method to design a integral controller to regulate the states of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. Compared to the traditional PID controller, our proposed controller can handle more general uncertainties beyond constant step disturbance, such as external time-varying disturbances with unknown magnitudes and internal modeling uncertainties due to unknown parameters. Moreover, the system states will converge to the origin and the unknown magnitude/parameter can be recovered from the integral state. 
%Specifically speaking, S \ref{preliminaries} proposes a new stability criterion for the stability analysis of a class of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying perturbations with unknown magnitudes. Chapter \ref{main} constructs integral controllers for a class of chain and nonlinear systems to achieve global regulation problems further more we analyzes a more general condition on  the time-varying perturbations with unknown magnitudes. Chapter \ref{EX} proposes several example to show the feasibility of the proposed strategies.
