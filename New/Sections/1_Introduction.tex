\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
interactive robots mission is a complex mission it need to nagvigate in complex and 
dynamic environment also need to fully flexable to planing the sequentially sub tasks. 
In order to achieve the goal we demo a method by utlize LLMs(large language model) and Reenforcement Learning. 
Our idea focuses on using an LLM's capacity for precise, short-horizon physical reasoning to 
dynamically select or modify the parameters of complex, learned robotic trajectories, 
effectively allowing the robot to autonomously execute tasks that previously required initial human intervention.
The conceptual framework of \textbf{Dynamic Penetrative Trajectory Adaptation (DPTA)}
represents a synthesis of three complementary AI paradigms. 
First, Penetrative AI enables contextual and semantic understanding by
leveraging large language model-based sensor comprehension for high-level intent extraction
and environmental interpretation. 
Second, the combination of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) and 
Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) contributes to adaptable trajectory generation
through shared autonomy, interactive learning, and human demonstration. 
Third, Robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) performs policy optimization and
closed-loop execution under uncertainty, ensuring real-time correction and robust action
adaptation. 
Together, these three paradigms form the foundation of the DPTA framework, enabling 
semantic reasoning, dynamic motion modification, and reliable trajectory shaping in complex 
robotic environments.
